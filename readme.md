Enigma
=======

Enigma is an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking
messages. The encryption is loosely based on the encryption algorithm used by the Enigma Machine during WWII.

#### Encryption Set

* The encryption is based on rotation
* The character map is made up of all the
characters defined in `@set`

#### The Key

* Each message uses a unique encryption key
* The key is five digits, like 41521
* The first two digits of the key are the "A" rotation (41)
* The second and third digits of the key are the "B" rotation (15)
* The third and fourth digits of the key are the "C" rotation (52)
* The fourth and fifth digits of the key are the "D" rotation (21)

#### The Offsets

* The date of message transmission is also factored into the encryption
* Consider the date in the format DDMMYY, like 020315
* Square the numeric form (412699225) and find the last four digits (9225)
* The first digit is the "A offset" (9)
* The second digit is the "B offset" (2)
* The third digit is the "C offset" (2)
* The fourth digit is the "D offset" (5)

#### Encrypting a Message

* Four characters are encrypted at a time.
* The first character is rotated forward by the "A" rotation plus the "A offset"
* The second character is rotated forward by the "B" rotation plus the "B offset"
* The third character is rotated forward by the "C" rotation plus the "C offset"
* The fourth character is rotated forward by the "D" rotation plus the "D offset"

#### Decrypting a Message

The offsets and keys can be calculated by the same methods above. Then each character is rotated backwards instead of forwards.

#### Cracking a Key

When the key is not known, the offsets can still be calculated from the message
date. We believe that each enemy message ends with the characters `"..end.."`. Use that to determine when you've correctly guessed the key.

Testing
-------
Testing is setup to use Minitest, rspec and mrspec. I recommend testing with mrspec. To do so, simply run 'mrspec' in the project root directory after downloading the mrspec gem.
